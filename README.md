# 🗓️ Timeline - Build, Explore and Share Your Histories with Style

## 📌 Overview

**Timeline** is an interactive web application for creating, **viewing, and editing historical, scientific, or personal timelines**.

Users can add periods and events, customize **colors, themes, and layers**, export/import data, and view item details. The project uses React, `Zustand` for state management, and `react-konva` for graphical rendering.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- ✅ **Create Periods and Events:** Add periods (time spans) and events (specific points) with title, description, color, and image.
- ✅ **Dynamic Visualization:** Scalable timeline with zoom, drag, keyboard navigation, and adaptive year markers.
- ✅ **Smart Layers:** Periods are automatically arranged into different levels to avoid overlap, with support for negative layers (below the main timeline).
- ✅ **Themes and Colors:** Multiple color themes for visual customization, with optional auto-coloring.
- ✅ **Side Panel:** Interface to add, edit, and view period/event details, including image search and upload.
- ✅ **Export/Import:** Save and load timelines as JSON files.
- ✅ **Advanced Settings:** Adjust spacing, height, base year, event radius, and other preferences.
- ✅ **Auto Description Generation:** AI (Cohere) integration to generate automatic descriptions for periods.
- ✅ **Image Search:** Unsplash integration for image search by keyword.

- Render the main timeline, year markers, periods, and events.
- Support zoom, drag, and keyboard navigation.

### 2. **PeriodsLoader & EventsLoader**

- Load and render all saved periods and events.

### 3. **Period & Event**

- Visually represent each period (rectangle) and event (circle) on the timeline.
- Support interactions: hover (show details), click (open edit panel).

### 4. **InfoCard**

- Displays details of the selected period/event, with delete option.

## 🧠 State Management

- **Zustand** is used to manage the global state of:

  - Periods and events (`periodsEventsLoaderStore`)
  - Timeline settings (`settingsStore`)
  - Side panel state (`sidePanelStore`)
  - Focused detail cards (`detailsBalloonStore`)
  - Zoom and stage position (`stageControlsStore`)

## 🧾 Main Types

```typescript
// Period
interface Period {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  image: string;
  color: string;
  start: SimpleDate;
  end: SimpleDate;
  level: number;
}

// Event
interface Event {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  image: string;
  color: string;
  date: SimpleDate;
}
```

## 🖥️ Running Locally

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure API keys (Unsplash and Cohere) in `.env`.
3. Run the project:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open in `http://localhost:3000` (or configured port).

## ❗ Notes & FAQ

### ❓ How do I add a period or event to the timeline?

Click the "Create" button on the top toolbar. Then, fill out the side panel form with title, description, dates, image, and color. Choose between event or period, save — and done!

### ❓ What is auto description generation and how does it work?

Timeline is integrated with the **Cohere** API, an AI service that can generate automatic descriptions for events or periods based on their title and dates. This feature is available in the side panel while editing or creating an item.

### ❓ Can I export and share my timeline with other users?

Yes! You can use the export function to save your timeline as a `JSON` file. This file can be shared or re-imported by other users using the same application, preserving all data and settings.
